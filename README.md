# EclecticIQ UI Home Assignment - form that auto-saves drafts

Hey!

Thank you for taking part in our recruitment process. We would like you to solve this home assignment. It's not time limited but it shouldn't take more than one hour. It will be followed up by a call with one of our engineers. During it, we will discuss your solution and ask you to add one more enhancement.

Once you are ready, please fork the sandbox.

1. We want a form for creating tasks in our product.
2. We want to auto-save drafts for every input the user does so that users donâ€™t loose their work-in-progress if close their browser or leave the page.
3. Draft should be saved and retrieved from a local storage.
4. When the user come back to the form, we want to load their draft.
5. When the user submit the form, their draft should be deleted and the form should be emptied.

Please remember, there is no one and best solution. We want to see how you write and structure your code.
